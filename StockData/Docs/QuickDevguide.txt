Application summary : 

This is demo feedhandler which stimulated working of reltime feed handler.
It will help to publish data as per given time interval. 
i.e. if you give command 
	./main V14DEWH6E2YMX20G AAPL 30 
application will publish data for symbol AAPL in every 30 seconds . 
It's useful to create fake market data feed for any symbol.

Working : 

App has two threads . 

1) Main thread : Controls creating feed, making API call and generating .json from fetched symbol 
2) Publisher thread : it's infinitely running thread which control publishing of ticks.

Code flow : 

./main V14DEWH6E2YMX20G AAPL 30 
main.cpp -> Request for symbol , creates feedhandler for symbol and launch publisher thread.
feedhandler.cpp -> create api call and generates symbol.json and parse data into 'double : value '
format from json 
publisher -> continuesly checks for data in InQ , if data is present and if current time is > last tick
published time it will publish a tick. 

Developers scope : 

1) Currently api use by default  outputsize = full , add option to make is configurable
2) Add config file and read parameter from it. 
3) Find out another way than regex parsing to parse .json file in "double : value" format.
